Leant to understand cultural differences. For last 16 years worked in customer service field. Received multiple awards, customers’ and colleagues’ compliments.
- ***Reliable***. I had seven consecutive years of perfect attendance (no sickness, no absent, no late) with Emirates Airline. I’ve never avoid working. Loyal employee.
- ***Analytical ability, decision-making***. Reached senior positions at previous jobs. Worked unsupervised as remote workforce on aircraft. Know how to find solutions. Step-by-step testing code myself.
- ***Attentive to details, organized***. I like automation: from creating mail handling rules, to writing reusable scripts and code snippets. Timely submitted reports about in-flight incidents after landing at previous work. Break job into smaller tasks and organise them in order of priority.
- ***Eager to learn***. Visited multiple workshops and qualification programs at all my past jobs. New to the field, so motivated and crave to write code.
- ***Task focused, meeting deadlines***. Achieved two all times record duty free sales on board. Sometimes worked under time pressure on short flights, and still completed services
